# Cubing Tournament Simulation
## About
Computes teams and simulates a cubing head-to-head relay tournament.

There are 13 cubers in a team, each cuber completing a solve for a single event. The events are: 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, 7x7, 3x3OH, 3x3BLD, Mega, Pyra, Sq-1, Skewb, Clock. 

In each match, two teams face off against one another. For each event, the cuber chosen to complete the solve for the given event will go head-to-head against the cuber chosen for that event from the opposing team. The team which has won the most events will proceed to the next round.

Teams are generated by scraping the top 100 cubers from the official WCA rankings page for a given event (average). The winner amongst two cubers in a head-to-head is determined by their ranking. If a cuber is ranked higher than the opposing cuber, they win the head-to-head.
